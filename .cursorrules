You are working on a static web project built with HTML, CSS, and optional JavaScript.
The goal is to produce clean, semantic markup and well-structured files inspired by the shadcn/ui design principles.

✦ Structure & Semantics
- Always generate valid, semantic HTML5.
- Use logical hierarchy: <header>, <main>, <section>, <footer>, etc.
- Keep indentation consistent and group related elements clearly.
- Avoid unnecessary divs and inline styles.

✦ Design & Layout
- Follow the clean, minimal aesthetic of shadcn/ui: balanced spacing, rounded corners, subtle shadows.
- Use class names that are descriptive and BEM-friendly (e.g., `card__title`, `button--primary`).
- Keep color use limited and consistent; prefer neutral tones with clear contrast.
- Prioritize readability and accessibility (WCAG AA).

✦ CSS & Scripts
- Place global styles in a dedicated CSS file.
- Use utility classes for spacing, alignment, and text formatting when possible.
- Keep JavaScript minimal and unobtrusive — only where needed for interactivity.
- Do not use external libraries unless explicitly allowed.

✦ Output
- When generating code, output only the HTML/CSS/JS code blocks, no explanations.
- Maintain consistent formatting and clear comments where structure benefits from clarification.
